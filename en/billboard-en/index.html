        <p><em>2021</em></p><p><em>Personal Project</em></p><p><em><a href="https://billboard-analisis.netlify.app/">See the final website here</a></em></p><p><em><a href="https://nbviewer.org/github/mt-romero/billboard-jupyter/blob/main/charts_for_web.ipynb">Check out the code I used to analyze this data.</a></em></p><h2 id="the-project">The project</h2><p>In order to learn data analysis in python and improve my data visualization skills, I decided to start a short project comparing the most popular songs of the years 2020 and 2010.</p><h2 id="the-process">The process</h2><p>I performed all the tasks in this project, from design and illustration to data analysis and data cleaning in python.</p><p>To build the database, I merged two Kaggle datasets, one with data from Spotify , containing general information about the songs: release date, rating as explicit, duration, etc; and the other with all the Billboard entries by date with rank. I used the Pandas library to do all the analysis and Plotly for the visualizations.</p><h3 id="the-data">The data</h3><p>As soon as I started examining the data, the differences between the two years became clear: not only were there more artists and more songs making it into the Billboard Hot 100 in 2020, in addition, the percentage of explicit songs had significantly increased.</p><p>When I dug deeper  something struck me about the list of songs that had reached number 1. The musical/genre was obvious, but also there were now fewer "repeat" artists. The most popular songs were no longer just Katy Perry or Bruno Mars songs, there was a bit more variety.</p><p>This realization, combined with the reduction in song lengths and more explicit songs in general seemed to suggest that in the last decade, musical change had been driven by music distribution channels. Streaming vs. radio, greater access to varied artists, less use of censored versions of explicit songs, internet trends that had put songs from several years earlier back on the chart...radio seemed to have lost ground as the trend-setting metronome.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="../../content/images/2021/12/porcentaje-explicitos.png" class="kg-image" alt srcset="../../content/images/size/w600/2021/12/porcentaje-explicitos.png 600w, ../../content/images/2021/12/porcentaje-explicitos.png 995w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Porcentaje de canciones explicitas por cada año. Gráfico extraido directamente de Plotly</figcaption></figure><p></p><p>So I decided to focus my analysis on these indicators of change: music genres, duration, number of artists, number of weeks in the rank per song, etc.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="../../content/images/2021/12/2010artistastop.png" width="995" height="900" alt srcset="../../content/images/size/w600/2021/12/2010artistastop.png 600w, ../../content/images/2021/12/2010artistastop.png 995w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="../../content/images/2021/12/2020artistastop.png" width="995" height="900" alt srcset="../../content/images/size/w600/2021/12/2020artistastop.png 600w, ../../content/images/2021/12/2020artistastop.png 995w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div><figcaption>Artistas con el número 1 en más semanas, 2010 vs 2020</figcaption></figure><p>In order to analyze the changes in the most popular music genres in the chart, I decided to focus exclusively on the songs that had reached number one. Getting accurate genre data for all the song in the chart proved to be a bit too difficult to do, so I opted to limit my analysis.  From this list of number 1 hits, I manually logged the genres and sub-genres of each song from Wikipedia. I considered the following to be the main (or "parent") genres:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../../content/images/2021/12/g-neros-1.svg" class="kg-image" alt></figure><p>For each sub-genre, I considered two of these main genres as "parents". For example, in the case of dance-pop (a subgenre with influences from pop and electronic music, often house music), its parents were Pop and EDM. Each song had between one and three subgenres on Wikipedia, so I classified each of them into their respective genres/sub-genres.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../../content/images/2021/12/g-neros-subg-neros.svg" class="kg-image" alt></figure><p>To keep the analysis simple, I limited the parents to only two genres. I also included disco and funk in the R&amp;B category and any type of electronic music in EDM one.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="../../content/images/2021/12/canciones-2010-1.svg" class="kg-image" alt><figcaption>Lista de canciones con géneros/subgéneros, 2010</figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="../../content/images/2021/12/canciones-2020.svg" class="kg-image" alt><figcaption>Lista de canciones con géneros/subgéneros, 2020</figcaption></figure><p>Other interesting observations included: number of weeks in the chart per song, artists per song, artists in both decades, etc. One interesting observation that I didn't get to include on the final website is the relationship between the date of first appearance on Billboard vs. the date of highest ranking. I didn't include it in this version of the analysis because I want to dig deeper into it. However, at a glance it is evident that in 2020 the songs reached their best position in much less time than in 2010.</p><h3 id="the-structure">The structure</h3><p>After analyzing the data, I decided to present it in a simple web page, with SVG graphics and visualizations, for practicality.  The Plotly visualization library includes a function to export the graphics in svg, so I based on that to create the visualizations.</p><p>To organize my ideas on how to present the analysis, I made a Wireframe. I wanted the data to tell a story, to follow a logical line. I organized it that way.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="../../content/images/2021/12/wireframe-billboard.svg" class="kg-image" alt><figcaption>Wireframe del sitio</figcaption></figure><p>The wireframe helped me realize something of utmost importance: it was necessary to adapt each graphic or data visualization graph to three different sizes (desktop, tablet and mobile) so that they could be appreciated well. Perhaps the biggest disadvantage of doing this project with SVG and not with a library like D3 is that SVG is not responsive by itself. As soon as I exported the graphics as html from Plotly I also realized that if I wanted to use them as HTML they would require a lot of customization and code to make them look the way I wanted. So in the end I opted to adapt the graphs myself to three different sizes.</p><p>I chose three specific dimensions that best suited the different types of visualizations.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="../../content/images/2021/12/gr-ficos-tama-os.svg" class="kg-image" alt><figcaption>Dos gráficos en tres tamaños.</figcaption></figure><p>I already had the analysis, I already had the plots/graphs adapted. I wanted to create a one-page site that would host this project and its future.</p><p>For the most "tangible" part of the project, the web, I started looking for references. I've always liked the aesthetics of virtual instruments or VST, they have a charm that is old-fashioned and avant-garde at the same time. Like a nineties idea of futurism.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="../../content/images/2021/12/image-2.png" class="kg-image" alt srcset="../../content/images/size/w600/2021/12/image-2.png 600w, ../../content/images/size/w1000/2021/12/image-2.png 1000w, ../../content/images/2021/12/image-2.png 1199w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Ui - Serum VST</figcaption></figure><p>Initially, I wanted to create something with a similar feel. The underlying theme of the analysis - how the shift towards streaming is trending in the structure and shape of popular music today - seemed to resonate quite well with this style.</p><p>However, the first concepts I made with this idea in mind did not convince me.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="../../content/images/2021/12/concepto-inicial-g-neros.svg" width="622" height="621" alt></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="../../content/images/2021/12/conceptos-inciales-cards.svg" width="596" height="657" alt></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="../../content/images/2021/12/conceptos-inciales-cards-2.svg" width="570" height="805" alt></div></div></div><figcaption>hmmm</figcaption></figure><p>Perhaps what made this aesthetic fit so well with VSTS is that the very concept of a virtual instrument is quite retro-futuristic. And the fact is also that the overloaded interfaces full of knobs and audio waveform that are so common in virtual instruments exist because the very functionality of the virtual instrument warrants it. It looks cluttered, yes, but in the end every element of that interface serves an important function.</p><p>I didn't want to abandon the concept entirely, but I wanted to modify it. I still wanted the website to have a dark interface, with contrasting vibrant colors. Without going too far from the music sphere, Spotify itself had this visual identity that caught my attention.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="../../content/images/2021/12/image-1.png" class="kg-image" alt><figcaption>UI de spotify, adjacente al cocepto que originalmente tenía para el sitio.</figcaption></figure><p>I decided to bite the bullet and try modifying what I had already done. Maybe a little less cluttered, maybe a lesser amount of different shades of grey. I already had in mind the colors to I'd use to differentiate 2010 and 2020, so I started from them to generate more components.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="../../content/images/2021/12/colores.svg" class="kg-image" alt><figcaption>colores para cada año</figcaption></figure><p>Cards were the main building block for this UI. Apart from graphics and visualizations, all the important information was going to be contained within cards. I didn't want to use a lot of text on the website (that's why I expand on it here), so the cards were my raw material to build the site.</p><p>I decided to clean them of all unnecessary elements, lines, shadows, etc, and use mainly text and color. I differentiated the cards with colors by year to make the reading of the data easier.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../../content/images/2021/12/cards-final.svg" class="kg-image" alt></figure><p>By focusing on cleaning up the UI elements, I managed to come up with a concept that I liked. From the wirefrme, I rebuilt each component in its cleanest version.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="../../content/images/2021/12/grupo-generos-antiguo-1.svg" width="304" height="1051" alt></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="../../content/images/2021/12/grupo-generos-nuevo-1.svg" width="551" height="1784" alt></div></div></div><figcaption>las tarjetas de géneros, antes y después</figcaption></figure><p>I wanted there to be a lot of contrast. Between the background and the text, the data and the background, the cards of one year versus another. The typographic scale also had to be contrasting. It's a comparison, an analysis that puts two moments in time one versus the other, so I decided to emphasize that contrast.</p><p>For the typographic scale I used a slightly modified version of 1.4 (rounded down instead of up) to ensure high contrast between the titles and the body. To further emphasize this contrast, I set the titles in black or bold.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../../content/images/2021/12/tipograf-a-1.svg" class="kg-image" alt></figure><p></p><p>One of the most complicated sections to design was the music genres.part. In the wireframe I had planned to have information from both years side by side and separate them by borders. I wanted the user to be able to compare the two states in one place, to see how the distribution of each genre had moved.</p><p>In my mission to clean up the whole UI, I thought I'd get rid of that concept and put each graphic/card one after the other, interspersing years. But it wasn't working. It didn't have the same punch. Obviously this layout was only possible on pc, tablet or mobile would be to small for it In the end, I kept the idea of having them together but I added badges to differentiate the year and used blurred color shadows instead of solid borders.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="../../content/images/2021/12/generos-card.svg" class="kg-image" alt><figcaption>wireframe vs diseño final</figcaption></figure><p>The most difficult task was actually adapting the visualizations to the graphic style of the site. I wanted to be as accurate as possible with the data, but there were visualizations that were simply not pleasant to read (like the one below, right). I had to decide when to cut non-essential information and what to keep in each plot.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="../../content/images/2021/12/plotly-edit.svg" class="kg-image" alt><figcaption>plots directamente exportados vs versión final</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, I made some decorative illustrations to break down the introduction and make it easier to read. I also made an illustration for the header</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="../../content/images/2021/12/ilustraciones.svg" class="kg-image" alt><figcaption>Ilustraciones para la web</figcaption></figure><p>I developed the site in HTML and CSS using a modified version of Bootstrap with SASS.
