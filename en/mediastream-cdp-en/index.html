Additionally, I developed the initial prototype of the module in React as a microfrontend to integrate it into Mediastream Platform.</p><h3 id="objectives">Objectives</h3><p>he project objectives were:</p><ul><li>Design an accessible and efficient module for user data management.</li><li>Create an intuitive funnel system to facilitate decision-making.</li><li>Test the effectiveness of the design with users and stakeholders.</li><li>Develop the module prototype in React for its integration into the platform.</li></ul><p></p><hr><h2 id="%E2%98%80%EF%B8%8F-the-design-improving-usability-and-aesthetics">‚òÄÔ∏è The Design: Improving Usability and Aesthetics</h2><h3 id="phase-one-the-problem-context-and-initial-approaches">Phase one: The Problem, Context, and Initial Approaches</h3><p>For the redesign of the CDP module, I started from the existing Customer module, which showed certain inefficiencies.

These interviews helped us understand their daily tasks, challenges, and objectives, <strong>revealing a critical need to access large volumes of data quickly and user-friendly. </strong>Based on this information, a detailed user profile was created, represented by Alejandro, the data analyst. This profile guided the module design, ensuring that the needs and expectations of the end users were effectively addressed.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.mt-romero.com/content/images/2024/07/image-3.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1364" height="686" srcset="https://www.mt-romero.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/image-3.png 600w, https://www.mt-romero.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/image-3.png 1000w, https://www.mt-romero.com/content/images/2024/07/image-3.png 1364w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Representaci√≥n del user persona principal</span></figcaption></figure><p>During the interviews, we also discovered a secondary user: in more manual companies and OTTs, we found <strong>administrators with little technical knowledge who were responsible for manually updating user data and managing subscriptions and payments. </strong>This user was accustomed to how the module already worked, so we took this profile into account to maintain the familiar experience.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.mt-romero.com/content/images/2024/07/image-5.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1364" height="814" srcset="https://www.mt-romero.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/image-5.png 600w, https://www.mt-romero.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/image-5.png 1000w, https://www.mt-romero.com/content/images/2024/07/image-5.png 1364w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Representaci√≥n del user persona secundario</span></figcaption></figure><h3 id="structure-and-functionality">Structure and Functionality</h3><p>Based on the requirements research, we determined that the CDP module had to offer three key actions focused on optimizing data management and decision-making:</p><ul><li><strong>Access user data</strong>: Users should be able to navigate and access detailed data about their OTT users' behavior and preferences. This functionality had to be designed to be intuitive and easy to use, allowing users to quickly find the information they need.</li><li><strong>Create user funnels</strong>: With this option, users could create custom funnels to analyze user behavior at different stages. Funnels would help identify patterns and optimization opportunities, facilitating informed decision-making. This was one of the biggest challenges of the project, as structuring and designing the interaction for funnel creation required a balance between functionality and usability.

This flexibility sought to offer greater customization in data visualization. However, during user testing, <strong>we discovered that this duality was confusing and overloaded the user experience.</strong> Test participants found it difficult to switch between the two types of graphs and preferred a simpler and more direct solution. <strong>This feedback led us to focus solely on the Sankey diagrams, as they provided a clearer and more visually appealing representation</strong> of data loss between each filter, facilitating a quick and efficient understanding of the information flow.</p><p>We conceived the funnel as a system in which the user starts with the general data (registered users) and adds filters of their preference, visualizing the results of each filter intuitively. <strong>The final data of the funnel is displayed on the general screen of the module, providing an overview of the filtered information. Additionally, we included the option to download the final data as a CSV file for further analysis, which responded to a specific need of users to delve deeper into the analysis outside the platform</strong>. This functionality was designed to facilitate the decision-making process, allowing users to identify patterns and optimization opportunities efficiently.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.mt-romero.com/content/images/2024/07/image-13.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="998" srcset="https://www.mt-romero.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/image-13.png 600w, https://www.mt-romero.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/image-13.png 1000w, https://www.mt-romero.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/07/image-13.png 1600w, https://www.mt-romero.com/content/images/2024/07/image-13.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>To optimize funnel creation in the CDP module, we added the option to apply multiple filters simultaneously, allowing users to build funnels more efficiently and accurately. <strong>This functionality was designed for users, like Alejandro, to combine multiple criteria and visualize how they interact in real-time, without needing to apply each filter individually and wait for the results. </strong>This improvement not only speeds up the data analysis process but also allows users to experiment with different filter combinations quickly and easily, facilitating the identification of patterns and optimization opportunities. The implementation of this feature was based on feedback received during user testing, highlighting the importance of a flexible and efficient tool for informed decision-making.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.mt-romero.com/content/images/2024/07/image-11.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="941" srcset="https://www.mt-romero.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/image-11.png 600w, https://www.mt-romero.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/image-11.png 1000w, https://www.mt-romero.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/07/image-11.png 1600w, https://www.mt-romero.com/content/images/2024/07/image-11.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Menu to add filters</span></figcaption></figure><p></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.mt-romero.com/content/images/2024/07/image-15.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1682" height="912" srcset="https://www.mt-romero.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/image-15.png 600w, https://www.mt-romero.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/image-15.png 1000w, https://www.mt-romero.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/07/image-15.png 1600w, https://www.mt-romero.com/content/images/2024/07/image-15.png 1682w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Modal to create multiple filters</span></figcaption></figure><p></p><p><strong>User Information</strong></p><p>n the original module, there was a user detail screen with detailed and editable information.
