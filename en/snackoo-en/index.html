        <p>2021</p><p><em>Personal Project</em></p><p><a href="https://framer.com/share/snackoo--wWHUQjxYQScgYQp2yjzT/CMvR9XJP2"><em>See the low fi prototype here</em></a></p><h2 id="the-project">The project</h2><p>I have celiac disease. That means I can't eat wheat, barley and rye. In principle that sounds simple, but in practice it's quite complicated: not all products or restaurants declare all the ingredients they use and gluten can be everywhere, even in things that seem as innocuous as tea. Not to mention the complexity of cross-contamination and all the restrictions that entails.</p><p>I rarely eat out anymore and I can't order a lot of things by delivery because I can't physically be in the store to read the labels. It's almost impossible for me to try something new because I can't tell if it has gluten or not.</p><p>Snackoo came about as an idea for a Rappi with an ingredient list. The idea was to be able to order snacks at any time without having to do the whole process of research, trial and error to find out if you can eat something. It sounds like an obvious solution, but I needed the insights of other people with dietary restrictions.</p><h2 id="process">Process</h2><h3 id="the-users">The users</h3><p>Among my acquaintances, I recruited three people with dietary restrictions: two with medical restrictions and one vegan person.</p><p>I focused the questions on understanding the user experience when ordering snacks through other delivery apps, specifically Rappi and JOKR. I chose these two apps specifically for two reasons.</p><ul><li>Rappi: In the experience of the users interviewed, it is the most used app for ordering snacks.</li><li>JOKR: 2/3 users had used it. I included it specifically because they have a different operating model that was interesting for users: stores in different locations and an app organized by categories, instead of asking for specific stores.</li></ul><p>Some of the insights from the interviews:</p><p></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/entrevista-1-1.svg" class="kg-image" alt></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/entrevista-2-1.svg" class="kg-image" alt></figure><p>I also observed users placing an order on the two apps mentioned above. One thing I found interesting is that all three used the <strong>search function </strong>first to find any products that cater to their restrictions. All three users decided to go for products <strong>they already knew </strong>were suitable for them or that they had tried before, even though all three expressed interest in trying new snacks.</p><p>The categories themselves also proved to be ineffective for finding products. In the case of Rappi specifically, they were useful for finding health food stores such as Flora and Fauna, but not for differentiating products with restrictions. In the case of JOKR, there was a category specifically for snacks with several subcategories, however none of these made reference to the ingredients of the products and the information for each product did not include ingredients or composition.</p><p>I took the opportunity to observe the user journey when using Rappi, and put together a costumer journey diagram to better visualize it.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/user-journey-3.svg" class="kg-image" alt></figure><p>Clearly, the biggest pain point in the user journey was <strong>not finding accurate food information and not being able to consume food spontaneously.  </strong>Users are disappointed with the search filter possibilities on Rappi. They prefer to consume something they have already consumed before not only because of a safety issue, but also because of <strong>the high price </strong>of the food they can consume. If they buy something they can't eat in the end, it becomes an unnecessary expense.</p><p>One of the main frustrations of the user, then, is feeling that they <strong>have no power over the food they eat.</strong> They are forced to continue consuming the same things in a monotonous way and can't try anything new. That the user feels disempowered is a terrible pain point that undoubtedly makes any experience related to food delivery a potentially bad experience.</p><p>From these observations, I constructed two personas based on the two main types of users:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/user-persona-2.svg" class="kg-image" alt></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/userpersona2-3.svg" class="kg-image" alt></figure><h3 id="the-structure">The structure</h3><p>To define the limitations of the "snack" concept, I also conducted a card sorting exercise with the users.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/card-sorting-1-1.svg" class="kg-image" alt></figure><p>Interestingly, there was quite a bit of controversy as to whether a sandwich qualifies as a snack or not. The consensus in the end was that while a sandwich might be a snack, it <strong>would not be the type of snack that users would order from a snack-only app, but would order from a restaurant.</strong></p><p>In the second exercise, we arrive at the following categories:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/card-sorting-2-2.svg" class="kg-image" alt></figure><p>Nuts and biscuits were a category in itself. Some products could be salty or sweet. In addition, users mentioned that while they didn't see drinks as snacks, they would like to <strong>be able to order snacks and drinks in the same app.</strong></p><p>From this research, I sorted out the main functions of the app:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/card-sorting-3-1.svg" class="kg-image" alt></figure><p>For the MVP, the key features (apart from delivery/e-commerce) were the restricted ingredient filters, ingredient list and nutritional information clearly demarcated and visible on each product page.</p><p>The user flow also reflects these six delimited sections, as well as the path the user would follow to perform the main task.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/user-flow-1.svg" class="kg-image" alt></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/sitemap-2.svg" class="kg-image" alt></figure><p>Once the whole structure of the app was defined, I made the wireframes and the low fi prototype of the mvp:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/wireframes-1.svg" class="kg-image" alt></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card kg-card-hascaption"><iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)" width="640" height="480" src="https://framer.com/embed/wWHUQjxYQScgYQp2yjzT/CMvR9XJP2" allowfullscreen></iframe><figcaption>MVP (in spanish)</figcaption></figure><p>User testing proved the presented solution to be a relief from the pain points discovered in the interviews. As this is only the MVP for now, other features of the app such as a list of favorites or comments on products could add more value to the final product.</p><p>On the negative side, users stressed that the system for removing/changing a product on the product page was somewhat confusing, and that they would prefer to have two separate buttons for each function.</p><h3 id="visual-identity"><strong>Visual identity</strong></h3><p>Finally, I designed a visual style for the app and its main components.</p><p>For the logo and brand colors, I chose dark green tones with vibrant pink accents. One of my goals when designing the visual style of the app was to make it <strong>clearly </strong>differentiable from other food apps. The last few years have seen a boom in delivery apps, many of them with similar visual styles. I wanted to move away from the yellows, reds and oranges that this kind of apps usually have.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/logo---colores.svg" class="kg-image" alt></figure><p>In the case of buttons, there are two defined variants: one rounded and pink used for interaction actions (go to the next page, accept an input) and another one with straight edges and dark green, used for purchase buttons. As the users suggested, the second button needs another run of iteration to match the user's expectations.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/Botones--inputs.svg" class="kg-image" alt></figure><p>For typography, I used open sans for optimal readability, in addition to the text scale used in Material Design,</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/tipograf-a-2.svg" class="kg-image" alt></figure><p>The most important elements in this design are undoubtedly the cards and tags. The products are contained within cards, as well as relevant information about them. The tags carry the allergen information/restrictions. The challenge was to make these two elements both distinctive and coherent.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/badges--cards.svg" class="kg-image" alt></figure><p>To unify these elements, I opted to use shades of the same supporting colors for the cards and tags. The color helps to separate them from the background, as well as a subtle box shadow.</p><p>For product cards, the real protagonist is the photo. Product cards leave almost all their space to be filled by photos. In my opinion, it is essential for a food app to give prominence to its product photos. This way, the user can more easily "scan" a list of products, for example, without the need to read the name of each product.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/mockups.png" class="kg-image" alt srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/12/mockups.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2021/12/mockups.png 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1600/2021/12/mockups.png 1600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w2400/2021/12/mockups.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Final mockups</figcaption></figure><p><strong>What's next?</strong></p><p>This is a project I'd like to take up again in a while. With more interviews and testing, I would like to optimize the user experience to make it as effective and good as possible.</p>
